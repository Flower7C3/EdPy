# EdPy

Microbric Edison robot using a subset of Python 2

This software is a service used by the EdPy web application to take a subset of python 2 and create a wav file
which can be downloaded to a Microbric Edison robot. As it is a service which the web-app uses it is strictly command
line!

There are a couple of main python programs:

* EdPy.py -- this will take a file of an edpy program, and compile, assembler and create a wav file for download
* EdAsm.py -- this tool can be used to assemble an assembler source file. EdPy.py does this and more! It is
  still available for working directly with the TASM assembler language
* TranStrings.py -- a tool to find all translatable strings and make sure they are used correctly. This will
  be used when we start the translation effort

All of these programs must be run using python 2.7 or later, but NOT python 3.0 or later. So it is a python 2 program,
which uses some python 2.7 additions, but it isn't cleanly python 3.0. All new code was developed using future
statements
to use new print functionality and import functionality so should be easy to go to python 3. But some code was taken
from EdWare (token assembler bits) so it will need more work.

All the main python programs have a 'help' option -- e.g. python2 EdPy.py --help.

Usage
--------

- Install on local computer:

  `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flower7C3/EdPy/master/install)`

- Compile Python code and play WAV file:

  `edpy SOURCE.py` (where SOURCE.py is Your file path)

- Uninstall from local computer:

  `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flower7C3/EdPy/master/uninstall)`

More examples
--------

To get help:
<pre>
python2 src/EdPy.py --help
</pre>

To compile a program:
<pre>
python2 src/EdPy.py src/en_lang.json SOURCE.py
</pre>

To just check a program. This doesn't generate a wav file.
<pre>
python2 src/EdPy.py -c src/en_lang.json SOURCE.py
</pre>

Turn on debugging output and get an assembler listing
<pre>
python2 src/EdPy.py -d 2 -a test.lst src/en_lang.json SOURCE.py
</pre>

Enjoy!
